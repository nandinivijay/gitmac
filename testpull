Git is a repository that is used for source code management in software development.
It allows multiple developers to work together.
The main purpose of Git is code reusability.

Git - It has local and remote repositories



GitHub(remote repo)  

It is basically software as a service. 
It is a storage that everyone can access by URL. 
It is a centralized place to keep the code.



Git(local repo)

It will be accessed by you only.
It will be used when you need to commit the code.




How to add a text file to GitHub


1. Install git in a local repository (git bash in windows, cmd prompt in Mac)

2. Create a folder called testgit (creating a folder on the desktop is a best practice. Keep the folder name as the same name as the remote repository name as a best practice)

3. Git init (open terminal -> cd folder -> git init) - It will create a new git instance for a project. 

4. Create a text file called sample.txt in the testgit folder; write something and save it. 

5. Git status - It will check the status of the repository

6. Git add sample.txt (git add . Will be used when you want to add more than one file) - The file will be added to the git repo. Also called staging

7. Git commit -m "message" - save those changes to the repository's history with a message

8. Create a remote repository by visiting GitHub.com (you should have a GitHub account before you proceed) - 
   follow the steps to create a remote repository
   (GitHub.com -> new -> name of the repository -> public -> create repository
   
9. Git remote add origin link of the GitHub repo - It will connect your local repository to the remote repository

10. Git push origin master - push the file to the remote repository. Now the file will be added to the remote repository.
